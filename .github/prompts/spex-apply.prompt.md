# Apply spec and/or design changes to the implementation

## Skills

Use the **[implement-the-spec](../skills/implement-the-spec/SKILL.md)** skill.

## Context

- Spec location: `spec/spec.md` and `spec/specs/*/spec.md`
- Test location: `test/`
- Implementation: `lib/`
- Other resources: `spec/resources/*`

## Your Task

1. Determine whether there is a design, spec, or user instruction already in the context. If there is, focus exclusively on that.
2. Iterate on the implementation until it fully matches the spec.
