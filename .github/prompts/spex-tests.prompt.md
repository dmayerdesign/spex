# Address all failing tests

1. Run tests by following the **test** skill in `.github/skills/change-or-fix/SKILL.md`.
2. Create a plan for how to address the failing tests. Categorize tests into:
    - False failures where the test needs to be fixed to match the spec/design/implementation
    - Legitimate failures that indicate a bug in the implementation that needs to be fixed
3. Ask the developer for approval before proceeding with your changes.
